Changing Element Names
----------------------

   3. Open the input, and change the placeholder text

FAQ
----------------------

   How do I change the hide/show key?

      *After starting up the test, navigate to the script object and change the
         values in the public areas.

   How do I change the output file name?

      *Follow the same thing as the previous question, but for file name instead

   How does the GainRig system work?

      *It utilizes the text variable inside the GainRig script, so you need to
         make the text variable public inside GainRig, and also provide its
         position to the ResearchGUI script. It should then output to the end
         of each line in the output.

  What do I do if the scale of the GUI is off?

     *Select the ResearchGUI element and in Canvas Scaler(script) change the UI Scale
	mode to be "Scale With Screen Size" then adjust "Screen Match Mode" to "Expand"
